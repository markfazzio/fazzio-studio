All of the cables come pre-labeled, you'd have to really not be paying attention to mess up. Watch the video on their website if you need step-by-step instructions, but if you're like me, you dive right in until you get stuck, and then refer to the video, right?

Here are a few photos of the cable upgrade, and what the crappy factory power cables look like compared to the 2AWG ones from KSuspensionFab.
